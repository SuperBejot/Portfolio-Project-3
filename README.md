# Escape from prison

## Introduction:

Escape from prison is a choose your own adventure game. It is targeted at users who would like to play an interactive story where their decisions will influence how the game story plays out.
The game was created and written using Python. It is a simple game where the player must make a choice that will allow him to complete the game successfully or will end the game with a negative result and will have to start the adventure from the beginning.

## Player's task:

On the first screen, the player will be asked to enter his name.
Thanks to this, he will be able to feel that he is part of the game. Because the name you give at the beginning will appear in subsequent stages of the adventure.
His task is to read the game script and at the right moment, he will have to make a choice by entering in the designated field one of the two prepared answers, which are in brackets at the end of the question posed to the player.
If the player makes the correct choices, he will finish the game successfully. However, if he makes a wrong choice, he will lose and will be able to try to complete the game again.
